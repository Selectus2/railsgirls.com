        Nothing, it's free! You just need to be excited!
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Who is this aimed for?</strong>
        Women of any age (over 21) with basic knowledge of working with a computer. We’ve had people of all ages taking part, most
        of the crowd usually is women in their twenties or thirties, but we truly welcome everyone.

    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Can men attend?</strong>
        Yes, but girls are given a priority as this is a workshop targeted for women. You're welcome to fork the project
        on Github and create another kind!
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>I know how to program - How can I help?</strong>
