      <h1>The How to Guide</h1>
      
      <h2>Hosting your first Rails Girls event</h2>
 
      <p> Our aim is to give tools for women to understand technology. The Rails Girls events do this by providing a great first experience on building the Internet. Rails Girls was There's something unique about the cocktail we've mixed in Finland, but in the future wish to see local events take place all around the world! This guide has been put together to help you get started. </p>
<p>Please contact us at team@railsgirls.com if you want to organise a local chapter. The roadmap for future events can be seen at <a href="http://railsgirls.com">www.railsgirls.com</a></p>

      <h3>The Basics</h3>
      <p>Rails Girls events are fully non-profit. We don’t charge the participants and do not pay for coaches or speakers. Participants don’t need any previous knowledge about programming and there is no age-limitation. All they need is a laptop and some curiosity. </p>
<p>The two-day event includes a lot of small group working and short focused talks on programming, design and web. No panel discussions or podium-talks - the spirit should be informal and hands-on. The more you can remove abstractions and add inclusivity the better. </p>

Boksiin: ails Girls philosophy

Show sparks & keep in mind the big picture. 

Explain, repeat and always tie what your telling into a larger context. 

Internet was made by people, and it doesn’t break by a little tinkering. Continuosly show the human side: encourage coaches to talk about 


Copy-pasting rules. 

Technology per ce isn’t central - the goal of every event is to make something!

      <h3>In English</h3>
  
 
      <blockquote class="quotes">
        I'm so excited to learn Ruby on Rails and I my heart leapt when I heard
        that you guys were organising this workshop!
      </blockquote>
      
      <blockquote class="quotes">
        I work as journalist. I think I and most of us journalists (especially women)
        understand far too little about computers.
      </blockquote>
      
      <blockquote class="quotes">
          I was so excited when I first heard about this workshop. This is exactly what
          the world needs! I hope this workshop helps other women overcome this huge
          obstacle that shouldn't be there in the first place!
      </blockquote>
      
      <blockquote class="quotes">
       I must admit that I've always had a huge intrest in
       programming but never really had the courage to ask anyone to teach me.
      </blockquote>
      
      <blockquote class="quotes">
        I'm in a team of two girls who are about to start their own business. And
        programming is one area that we need to know about, but we don't, yet!
      </blockquote>
      
      <blockquote class="quotes">
        I would like to get to know other enthusiastic women, who share the same
        kind of attitudes and interests, second reason would be that I'm really into web
        design, but have very limited knowhow on building web applications myself.
