      <h1>The How to Guide</h1>
      
        <h2>Hosting your first Rails Girls event</h2>
 
          <p>Our aim is to give tools for women to understand technology. The Rails Girls events do this by providing a great first experience on building the Internet. Rails Girls was founded in end of 2010 in Helsinki, as a one-off event - however, there seems to be something unique about the cocktail we've mixed in Finland and in the future we hope to see local events take place all around the world! This guide has been put together to help you get started.</p>
          
          <p>Please contact us at team@railsgirls.com if you want to organise a local chapter. The roadmap for future events can be seen at <a href="http://railsgirls.com">www.railsgirls.com</a></p>


          <h3>The Basics</h3>
            <p>Rails Girls events are non-profit. We don’t charge the participants and do not pay for coaches or speakers. Participants don’t need any previous knowledge about programming and there are no age-limitations. All the participants need is a laptop and some curiosity. </p>
      
<p>The two-day event includes a lot of small group working and short focused talks on programming, design and web. No panel discussions or podium-talks - the spirit should be informal and hands-on. The more you can remove abstractions and add inclusivity the better. </p>

<h4>Rails Girls philosophy</h4>
<p>
<!-- Nää vois taittaa esim. johonkin boksiin? -->
<ul><li>Show sparks, personality and keep in mind the big picture. Explain, repeat and always tie what your telling into a larger context. </li>
<li>Internet was made by people, and it doesn’t break by a little tinkering. Continuously show the human side: encourage coaches to talk about open source communities, their programming idols and their aspirations. </li>
<li>Copy-pasting rules. Programming per ce isn’t central - you can't really learn to speak chinese in one day, neither coding - the goal of every event is to make something visible!</li></ul></p>

  <h3>Programme</h3>
<p>
Every Rails Girls event starts with an installation fest where the setup is pre-installed to the girls computers. See <a href="http://railsgirls.com/install">railsgirls.com/install</a> for readymade instructions. The installation fest can include short talks, but the main point is to offer some sparkling wine, get everything set for the next day and the girls to know each other. The timeframe is tentative - you know your audience and what suits them best. We've hosted events both during weekend and weekdays. Also, doing two evenings (4PM - 22 PM) might be a more suitable solution for your community needs.</p>
<p>
  <!-- Nää vois taittaa esim. johonkin boksiin? -->
<h4>Learning objectives of the workshop: </h4>
<p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understanding what is the difference between dynamic and static web page.</li>
      <li>Vocabulary of the web: developing a basic understanding of what components make a web application. Understanding the ABCs of coding: strings, methods, variables, arrays, exclamations, chaining, hashed, symbols, blocks.. as well as the tools (terminal, browser, text editor). Creating a conceptual understanding of webs building blocks: programming languages, frameworks, databases, infrastructure. </li>
      <li>Have an idea of how to move forward in the programming world: both online and offline. </li></p>

<h4>Example programme</h4>
<h5>Friday evening: Installation</h5>
<h6>19:00 - 21:00 Installations and getting to know each other</h6>
<p>Have enough coaches to help with installation problems. Have a coach-table where problematic computers can be brought to. Some installations will fail: be prepared to set girls in pairs, don't use endless amounts of time.</p>
<p>Go through the program for the next days, introduce the coaches. Maybe say a few words about programming in general or have a quick design workshop?</p>
<p>Try to speak a little with everyone. Sparkling wine helps!</p>

<p>
  <strong>Tips:</strong> decorate the place with balloons and posters. Make together a fun <a href="http://open.spotify.com/user/lindaliukas/playlist/1fgkUFCFDrSn621kf4iHhr">playlists</a> for the evening! Come up with activities to break the ice: ask the girls to write why they are attending the event on post-its or draw their dream web app. </p>

<h5>Saturday: </h5>
<h6>09:00 - 10:00 Registration and coffee</h6>
<p>Reserve enough time for people to mingle and to solve any problems there might be with installations. Set up a table for name badges (with teams assigned) and goodie bags. Take everyones e-mails as they come in!</p>
<p>Set up a bowl where girls can leave their acronyms for the <a href="/.">Bentobox exercise</a>. </p>

<h6>10:00 - 10:10 Welcoming words</h6>
<p>Say a few friendly words: why we are here, what the girls can look forward to learning. Showing what we’ll build and how you can do many things around one simple idea. </p>
<!-- vois olla näille example deckeille ja extra-matskuille oma tyyli -->
<p>Example slides at: slidedeck.com/u/railsgirls</p>

<h6>10:15 - 11:15 Introduction to programming</h6>
<p>A basic lecture on programming. Ask one of the coaches to do this - let him or her prepare in advance. The other coaches should also comment. Encourage early on a participative and open athmosphere where asking questions is ok. See also <a href="/.">tips for coaches.</a> </p>
<ul><li>The difference between dynamic and static websites: what are web apps?</li>
<li>What are programming languages? What is Rails? </li>
<li>The tools we’ll be using: browser, terminal, code editor, folder structure</li>
<li>Show & tell with <a href="http://tryruby.org">tryruby.org</a></li>
<!-- vois olla näille example deckeille ja extra-matskuille oma tyyli -->

<p>
<strong>Tips:</strong> walk through slowly the tryruby.org execises so that the girls can follow on their computers. First three-four chapters might be enough. Write down the terms you use, stop when there are questions. Explain why learning Ruby basics is 

11:30 - 13:00 Workshop time
- Going through (slowly!) the curriculum at railsgirls.com/app. Stopping to explain what you’re doing or the different concepts. It might be useful for the girls to have a printed version of the app structure they can easily follow. 

Try to aim for simple explanations even with the cost of accuracy. You don’t need to talk about all underlining concepts. Just try to answer questions when they arise, or move on if they’re too hard or out of scope. You are not there to teach perfect coding skills but to show how the get stuff done. One has to learn how to build web apps before learning how to do it well.

 Concepts to cover:
Rails Generators
Rails App Structure (scaffolding)
Bundler and Gem Management
MVC, REST/Resources, Scaffolds
Models and Active Record
Controllers and ActionController
Views and ERB
If time: 
File Uploading and Paperclip
APIs (with JSON/XML)

Example slides at: slidedeck.com/u/railsgirls

- Coaches are people too. They are doing this for the first time too. Teaching might be hard and intimidating, so remember to be available to help coaches or groups with difficult situations or just provide support and encouragement.

13:00 - 14:00 Lunch
Lunch tables can have Bird-of-Feather topics, such as Rails, HTML5 etc. that the girls & coaches can discuss. 

10:10 - 10:30 Designing the web
How to approach web app design
- Easy prototyping exercises and sharing design tips. 
- Underlining simplicity and role of mock-ups
Example slides at: slidedeck.com/u/railsgirls

14:00 - 14:30 Bentobox exercice
Putting technical jargon into a context with a conceptual model called Bentobox. Two exercises: 1) Going through the 10 technical concepts with the physical Bentobox boards. 
2) Going through the words the girls have themselves submitted with the coaches. 

Example slides at: slidedeck.com/u/railsgirls
 
14:30 - 18:00 Workshop time. 
- Room for lighting talks from the coaches or local developers
- As everyone has finished their app, there is time to extend the application by modifying the CSS, implementing commenting systems etc. Allow enough time for experimentation.
- At the end, have participants present projects and encourage them to push their apps into Heroku. Motivate into action: mention the next event. 

19:00 After party, where also everyone who couldn’t make it to the actual workshop are invited. 


Example topics for lighting talks: 
- Real programmers telling what their career has been like. 
- Design: UX & UI workshops. Making mockups together either with paper or computer. 
- Fun ways of explaining technical concepts and recent frameworks: what is CoffeeScript explained in 80s pop songs? How would you describe GitHub?
- All kind of creativity is strongly supported!
- Show us something real:  don’t speak in abstractions, be spesific and tell stories. 

All the tools and curricular content evolve by community input. We’d be happy to include ideas and additional exercises at railsgirls.com/app. What did work well or what didn’t? Let us know!

All girls receive a goodie bag at the beginning of the day. The bag includes stickers, a workbook exclusively given out in the Rails Girls events and possible sponsor swag.

      
      
      
      <h3>Promotion of Rails Girls</h3>
<p>Every Rails Girls workshop will get a custom website at railsgirls.com/city where the information is collected and then stored. For past cities, see <a href="railsgirls.com/events">railsgirls.com/events</a></p>
<p>
      While the event is underway, remember to take pictures, collect tweets and ask questions from the participants. We love to write blog posts about the speaker and participant experiences. Also a list of the coaches is required.</p>

<h4>How to find local developers? </h4>
      - Google. Almost every country has some sort of a Rails or Ruby community (sometimes called Ruby Brigade or Ruby Tuesday). Check out Hackernews, Reddit, GitHub, Dribbble. Find the local open source scene. Surf the technology conferences. IRC & Twitter, podcasts!
      - Check out hashtags like #rails #ruby #opensource and check the radius into as low as possible.  
      - Startup community. Startup Digest is a good beginning point for events and communities. 
      - Often there is one or two key persons who will be able to introduce you further, the technology world is surprisingly connected.

<h4>How to find participants?</h4>
<ul><li>Use social media: Facebook, Twitter & local networks such as Weibo. </li>
      - Local Girls in Tech or Geek Girl chapters. Other female networks. 
      - Meetup.com
      - Think outside the box: universities, book clubs, music stores, design agencies. We want girls who are interested in technology, but they can still have very varied backgrounds. 

<h4>How to get press?</h4>
One of the big aims of Rails Girls is to make it more mainstream for girls to build the web. That’s why we like to engage the local press and bring front the participants and their enthusiasm. We’d be happy to help prepare a press-release for the media. Check out railsgirls.com/press for more. 

      - Some tips to make a press-release:
      
<h4>A word about branding</h4>
        
        
        
        Software is a craft, showing. Telling the human side. We encourage our coaches to talk about open source, the fierece figures in programming, the magical stories of _why's dissapearance or David's hear. 

        We want to redefine technology. Pinboard. More Sophie Coppola than Barbie.
        
        <h3>Sponsorships</h3>

        Why is this is a great opportunity?
        Rails Girls reaches to a demographic that is hard to reach other ways: women who have an interest in technology. For sponsoring companies this is a very  - many users, possible employees, partners. 

        What kind of sponsors we’re looking for?
        - Active participants in the local technology scene, whether it’s a startup or a big corporation, a non-profit or a government organization. 
        - Also non-traditional technology companies can be approached: kids stores, universities, women's magazines, beverage brands etc. They all should however have some affiliation or interest in technology. 
        - Sponsors should be approved beforehand by the organising team. The biggest cost is the space. Other costs include gift bags, print materials, speaker gifts, lunch, drinks, afterparty, coach dinner and travel expenses. 
        - We need a logo, contact information and a 140 character description from the company in advance. 

        What do sponsors get?
        - Logo on event website
        - Rollup space at event, opportunity to distribute handouts and/or swag
        - Possibility to speak for 5 minute
        - Opportunity to host after party
        - Opportunity to host lunch
        - Press package - pictures they can use. 

        - We don’t give out the participant info, but sponsors are free to hang out at the event and we’ll be sure to include a short message to the thank you -note. 
        - Sponsor swag may be included in the goodie bag to an extent: however it should be something tasteful, not trashy and related to girls.

        <h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>Who can organise a Rails Girls workshop?</strong><br/>
        Anyone. What we look for is a group of people dedicated in making this a stellar first experience in the world of web making for girls. What we hope to see is some (not all) of the following: </p><p>
<ul><li>* Contacts to the local developer scene. We are pretty technology agnostic, so it doesn’t have to be purely Ruby & Rails people. In practice every event needs 5 or more coaches that have basic knowledge of Rails and two days to contribute. In general the events have been around 25 - 40 people strong. </li>
<li>* Event organisation know-how. Not heaps, but some practicalities under the belt.  </li>
<li>* An inkling of an idea where to look for girls interested in technology. University, literature, arts, sports - we try to look for people who are interested in Internet, but do not have experience in coding. </li>
<li>* Willingness to guide the girls in the future if they have questions or want to organize their own events or find local developer gatherings. </li></ul></p>
<p>Start by filling out railsgirls.com/inyourcity and someone from our team will be in contact</p>


<p><strong>What kind of venue is needed?</strong></p>
<p>
We recommend choosing a venue with a built-in infrastructure for around 30-50 persons. For a programming event, this means: </p>
<p><ul><li>High-speed, tested Internet. There’s going to be over 30 computers online all the time. Add to that mobilephones, streaming music, funny videos and you get the picture! </li>
  <li>Space for 4-6 person groups to gather together: chairs and tables, sometimes big pillows will do! This doesn’t have to be in the same room.</li>
<li>Possibility to set up extension chords and a projector.</li>
<li>Location for food and beverage setup - lunch space for catering or a nearby lunch venue. </li>
<li>External monitors for teams are encouraged but not mandatory, helps the coaches show what is happening in the code. </li></ul></p>
<p>Ask where local developer meetings are usually hosted. Often co-working spaces are also willing to negotiate deals to gain some visibility among new people.</p>

<p><strong>What is expected from the coaches?</strong>
        Rails Girls events are organised around small groups, ideally maximum of 4-5 persons per one coach. The coaches don’t need to be hardcore experts on Rails - basic knowledge and willingness to explain trumps expertise. We are looking for people who like answering questions and can keep an upbeat and positive atmosphere through a period of 8 hours! 

        You can get to know the curriculum by checking out railsgirls.com/app. There is also always a pre-event coach dinner where we’ll go through some pedagogical suggestions and check everyone knows what is happening. Avoid jargon, tie examples to what your doing, encourage asking questions. The installation instructions can be found at railsgirls.com/install

        We hope the coaches are ok with having their name and twitter-id/github/some mean of contact on railsgirls.com so the girls always have a local face to answer their questions. 

        In addition, we encourage coaches to come up with additional exercises for the group. After completing the ideation app many girls will want to try tweaking the look & feel of the site, implementing commenting, Facebook sharing, pushing the app to Heroku etc. We have some plans to include these coach-planned mini-lectures in the site as well.

        What materials do I get?
        Each Rails Girls event gets a webpage. In addition we’ll deal out the goodie bags, poster templates, balloons and other swag. There’s a project planning template and tons of experience from the founding team ; )

        How do you choose attendees?
        In the form we ask only two questions: do you have any previous background in coding and why would you be a good participant for Rails Girls

        Rails Girls is intended for anyone and we want to keep it flexible enough for learners any age. However, make clear to the attendees what to expect: Rails Girls won’t make anyone into a coder, so people looking for i.e career change will be disappointed. On the other hand we like people with very diverse backgrounds and loads of enthusiasm. 

        After selecting participants we generally split them into three groups: 1) people with no previous programming experience 2) people with some frontend experience (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and 3) people with a little experience in programming or a background in computer sciences. 

        What happens after the event?
        Inviting real developers to coach is Rails Girls sessions not only gives the participants a chance for hands-on education, but also makes the barrier to enter the technology world lower. How to keep the girls coding?
        * Encourage them to continue practicing. We’ll make a mailing list of the participants so the coaches can suggest local events. The guidebook also introduces a lot of web services. 
        * You can also host local meetups at http://www.meetup.com/Rails-Girls/ - we’ll be happy to promote any additional events
