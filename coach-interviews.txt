A Rough Guide for performing the Interview (for Interviewers)

The interview you perform will need be prioritised by the publishers based on variety, event relevance etc., so when writing the interview into a word document (for example) start it with the following details for editorial purposes. Please use at least a couple of the template questions (which will ensure the capture of a minimum selection of information about the coach), but feel free to ask new and interesting ones specific to location and what might highlight the unique experiences of the coach.
