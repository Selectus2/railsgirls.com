        <h2>Sponsor Prospectus</h2>
        <p>
          Rails Girls & viva-LA-vue is a three-day free event targeted at women to give them a great first experience in software craftmanship. We aim to impart inspiration to get started, tools to understand technology, and an open, supportive community.  Rails Girls is not just about programming, itâ€™s about building things. During the workshop, attendees will build their first Ruby on Rails application with help and guidance from their coach.  We will also have inspiring lightning talks and exercises.
